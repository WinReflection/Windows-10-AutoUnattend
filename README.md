# Windows 10 AutoUnattend
This repository is for the managment of an AutoUnattend.xml answer file for the automated installation of Windows 10 via a USB drive. The answer file is created in Windows System Image Manager (WSIM) which is included in the Windows 10 ADK files. Although the repository says "Windows 10", answer files for others flavors of Windows 10 such Enterprise and Enterprise LTSC will be added in the future.

---
## Process Creation and Installation:
1. Official Windows 10 source files.
2. Windows 10 ADK and Microsoft Deploeyment Toolkit (MDT) installed on a supported version of Windows 11.
3. Generate catalog file (.clg) with Windows Image System Manager (WSIM) from source files.
4. Create answer file in WSIM from available settings in the generated catalog file (.clg).
5. Save answer file as AutoUnattend.xml.
6. Place AutoUnattend.xml on root of USB drive.
7. Have USB drive insterted into computer during install of Windows so Setup.exe can find it.
8. Windows installs automatically.

## Troubleshooting:
- If step #7 fails it's possible Windows source files in use does not contain USB controller or chipset drivers for your computer so the USB drive will not be seen. Certain USB controller hubs might not be detected, some USB ports may be detected where others are not. Additonaly the Terms of Service Agreement Windows may present itself as the installer boots before the USB drive is detected, in many cases you just have to click "OK" and automated install will continue.
## Goals
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is Microsoft's official method for deploying Windows 10 to computers. Therefore, I want to make sure the Answer Files in this repository do not deviate too much or at all from Microsoft's defaults if possible. 
## Building Notes
- Answer Files where first generated in MDT and then edited with WSIM to be compatible for USB deployment (AutoUnattend.xml), keeping Microsoft's default values when images are imported into MDT. 
- Selecting in MDT: %DeploymentShare% -> Task Sequences - > Select Task Sequences -> Properties (Right-click menu) -> Edit Unattend.xml (Button) will start generating a catalog file (.clg) for the source image linked to the task sequence. Located: %deploymentshare%\Operating Systems\Windows 10 22H2 RTM x64\sources\install_Windows 10 Pro.clg.
- The default Unattend.xml file is located at: %DeploymentShare%\Control\%TaskSequenceID%\Unattend.xml.
## Files
- install_Windows 10 Pro.clg - Catlog file generted by WSIM for Windows 10 Pro.
- Unattend.xml - Default answer file generated by MDT for Windows 10 Pro.
- AutoUnattend.xml - Answer file for USB installtion, as close to the Microsoft's defaults as possible.
